This game was developed to integrate browser's multithreading capability into websites.
To demonstrate how one thread can lock another thread, block Juggernaut's punch by pressing z right before he strikes.  The Juggernaught's grey appearance was put in intentionally  to show that the thread is put to sleep while an instance() function takes place for carrying out additional algorithm before the thread wakes up.
