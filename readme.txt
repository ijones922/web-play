The Basics of Building a Website
Outlining the Type of Website

Let us begin with the purpose of your intended website. The reason this must be thought out at the beginning is to enable you to plan for development. Depending on the purpose, it may also mean you have to do a lot more research!

For simplicity, let's assume there are three basic types of web site: the hobby site (this includes family sites, genealogy, etc.), the information site, and the sales site.
The Absolute Minimum Required

The absolute minimum requirement on a domain is an index page and a text editor such as notepad.

This will have the url: www.anydomain.com/index.html

When a browser locates a domain, it automatically searches for a page called, index.htm. If it cannot find index.htm, it searches for index.html, then index.php, unless the server has been specially configured to do something else.

If index.htm is unavailable, the browser will display the contents of the folder in tree form as a set of hyperlinks to whatever is contained within it.

Index.htm or index.html is therefore, your most important page. It can be as short or as long as you like. There are no limits or restrictions so long as it contains the basic html elements which tell the browser how to display it.

To give you an idea of just how simple HTML is, I have created a page called the-most-basic-webpage.htm (opens a new window). To create the page, I used:

<html>
<body>
	<h1>Hello. Welcome to web playground 101</h1>
</body>
</html>

That's it! Written in Notepad and saved as a .htm file. Try it!

If you are not sure how to do that, save it as a text file (.txt), then rename it using the .htm extension.

Example: your-web-page.txt = your-web-page.htm
